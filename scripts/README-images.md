To replace visuals:
1) Generate images using your preferred AI tool.
2) Export as .png or .webp.
3) Put them into /public/images using the SAME NAMES:
   - hero-device.webp (or .png)
   - screenshot-1.webp
   - screenshot-2.webp
   - screenshot-3.webp
   - abstract-ai.webp
   - abstract-health.webp
   - map-hotspot.webp

Then update lib/content.ts paths from .svg to .webp (or keep SVG until replaced).
